# ChatApp
It is an open-source app with real-time messaging using Firebase and Node Js.

Original source: https://github.com/krishkamani/ChatApp

Note: the code is updated to modern Android version (SDK 33), tested on real devices 
with Android 12 and Android 8.

You need to setup your Firebase service and download your own google-services.json 

* For Authentication use Email+Password and Google

In Firebase console use project **SimpleChat** (simplechat-6671c)

* For Authentication use Email+Password

* For Realtime Database use this rule (see : https://medium.com/@juliomacr/10-firebase-realtime-database-rule-templates-d4894a118a98)

```plaintext
// Only authenticated users can access/write data
{
 "rules": {
 ".read": "auth != null",
 ".write": "auth != null"
 }
}
```

```plaintext
{
  "rules": {
    // User profiles are only readable/writable by the user who owns it
    "users": {
      "$UID": {
        ".read": "auth.uid == $UID",
        ".write": "auth.uid == $UID"
      }
    },

    // Posts can be read by anyone but only written by logged-in users.
    "posts": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth.uid != null",

      "$POSTID": {
        // UID must match logged in user and is fixed once set
        "uid": {
          ".validate": "(data.exists() && data.val() == newData.val()) || newData.val() == auth.uid"
        },

        // User can only update own stars
        "stars": {
          "$UID": {
              ".validate": "auth.uid == $UID"
          }
        }
      }
    },

    // User posts can be read by anyone but only written by the user that owns it,
    // and with a matching UID
    "user-posts": {
      ".read": true,

      "$UID": {
        "$POSTID": {
          ".write": "auth.uid == $UID",
        	".validate": "data.exists() || newData.child('uid').val() == auth.uid"
        }
      }
    },


    // Comments can be read by anyone but only written by a logged in user
    "post-comments": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth.uid != null",

      "$POSTID": {
        "$COMMENTID": {
          // UID must match logged in user and is fixed once set
          "uid": {
              ".validate": "(data.exists() && data.val() == newData.val()) || newData.val() == auth.uid"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

old Rule with Timeout:
```plaintext
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "now < 1670886000000",  // 2022-12-13
    ".write": "now < 1670886000000",  // 2022-12-13
  }
}
```

* For storage use this rule:
```plaintext
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```
